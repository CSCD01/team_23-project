           understands the architecture of the project.

   __5_ / 5 A reader, initially unfamiliar with the architecture of the
           project, has a good overview of the project structure after
           reading the report.

   __4_ / 5 UML diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful.

The reverse engineering generated UML seems missing many major classes.
High-level UML misses some necessary interaction between script layer and other 2 layers.


Software Process: __15_ / 15

   __7_ / 7 Every aspect of the software process is explained to an adequate
           level of detail.

   __8_ / 8 There is a thorough explanation of why this particular
           process works for this particular team. The arguments for
           the choice of the process and any modifications are
           well-informed and well explained. The pros and cons of
           different processes are carefully considered.
