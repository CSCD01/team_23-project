42/45

__10_ / 10  (5 marks per issue) DETAILED issue descriptions for both issues considered, including UML diagrams, code traces, etc.

__9_ / 10  Report on reasons for selecting the issue to implement, including DETAILED implementation plans.

Expect you can show your new added functions in you UML (for 11115).

_4__ / 5 A complete and comprehensive acceptance test suite for the selected issue.

Better to have the expected result included in the report.

_9__ / 10  Architecture document. Now that we know more about architecture, we expect a more informed analysis. Among other aspects, the following should be discussed:
-- architectural style; architectural pattern if applicable
-- description of all components
-- description of interfaces between components
-- discussion of level of coupling between components
-- discussion of cohesion of components
-- how are each of the following addressed with architectural choices (if applicable)
   -- performance
   -- security
   -- safety
   -- availability
   -- maintainability


Generally goood, can talk a little bit more about architectural choices (e.g. give some concrete examples)

__10_ / 10 Presentation and Quality of Writing. Same criteria as before.
