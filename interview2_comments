          design/architecture of the project?
       -- What software design decisions did you make? Why were these
          the best decisions?

Present software processes, methods, and tools that you used in
  your work:
/ 5  -- Describe the specifics of the software process.
/ 2  -- Explain why this process worked (or didn't work!) for your
        team for your project.
/ 3  -- Reflect on the good and bad decisions you made along the way,
        and any course corrections you made.

I was happy to see that you were well prepared for the presentation.
You clearly knew what you were talking about. However, the presentation
itself could have been greatly improved. In general, reading a prepared
script does not work well, especially in the absence of visual aids. 

You were able to answer my questions well.
The demo was good.
You addressed issues of design and implementation without my prompts
-- excellent!
I was happy to see that you put in the work to learn a software process
and apply the knowledge in your project.
Overall, I am happy to see that you were able to produce a significant
contribution as part of the course.
